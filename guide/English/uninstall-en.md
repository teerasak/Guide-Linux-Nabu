# Running Linux on the Xiaomi Pad 5

## Uninstallation

### Why is this needed?

If you want to uninstall linux this is used instead of deleting partitions manually to avoid human error + writing a whole dedicated guide to just uninstalling.

If you want to relock your bootloader you'll need your partition table to be stock.

### Uninstall with lon-tool

```cmd
lon-tool uninstall
```
